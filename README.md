A console game, very similar to Zork.

What is the plot: you are a scientist that came up with cloning, but, well, for some reasong they put you into the cell because of it. You certainly need to escape.

Gameplay part is this:
- you go in different directions, mqybe there is nothing in that direction, but maybe you can walk into something else. You can also examine some things.

If you're feeling stuck, you can always ask for help and see the list of available commands.

See the latest version of the game build in the releases - the thing is not completed yet, we need to make more content, but it's already pretty playable!
